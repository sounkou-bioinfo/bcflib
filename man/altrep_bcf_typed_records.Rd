\title{Create an ALTREP list of properly typed BCF/VCF records}
\usage{
altrep_bcf_typed_records(filename)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{Path to a BCF/VCF file}
}
\value{
An ALTREP list of properly typed nested lists
}
\description{
This function creates an ALTREP list where each element is a nested list
representing one record from the BCF/VCF file with properly typed fields.
Records are read on-demand, avoiding loading the entire file into memory.
}
\details{
The structure of each record is a nested list with the following components:
\itemize{
  \item CHROM - Chromosome name (character)
  \item POS - Position (integer, 1-based)
  \item ID - Variant ID (character, or NULL if missing)
  \item ALLELES - Character vector of REF and ALT alleles
  \item INFO - Named list of INFO fields with appropriate types
  \item FORMAT - Named list of FORMAT fields, including GT and others
}

Genotypes (GT) are returned as an integer matrix with samples as rows
and alleles as columns. Each value represents an allele index (0 for REF, 
1 for first ALT, etc.) or NA for missing data. The matrix has an attribute
"phased" indicating whether genotypes are phased.
}
