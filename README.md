# bcflib

Utility functions to manipulated BCF/VCF files in R based on l  [vcfppR](https://github.com/Zilong-Li/vcfppR) functions and additional utilities. 

The main motivating gaol is to ultimately reproduce the fantastic [bcftools munge](https://github.com/freeseek/score) utility as a faster alternative to the great [{MungeSumstats}](https://github.com/Al-Murphy/MungeSumstats). 

TODO
- Add some [htslib](https://github.com/samtools/htslib) 
  - faidx functions for fasta manipulation
  - kfunctions for interval
